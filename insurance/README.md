# ICON Insurance Fund:
This contract will store ICX that can be used to compensate damaged parties in the case of an exploit of ICON, Balanced, or any other product critical to ICONâ€™s infrastructure.
Releasing these funds will be at the discretion of validators. Unless released, these funds are locked and non-circulating.

## Overview
The insurance fund implements a transfer method only accessible by the owner of the contracts, which in a live environment should be the governance contract.

```java
/**
 * Transfers 'amount' ICX to 'to'
 *
 * @param to address which receives payout.
 * @param amount to pay out.
 */
@External
public void transfer(Address to, BigInteger amount) {
    onlyOwner();
    Context.transfer(to, amount);
}
```
